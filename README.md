In this repository I have used numpy library.
In which I have used different fuctions of the numpy.
In which I have used concatenate fuction which helps us to combine to array.
I have used max function which helps us to find maxmium value of the  array.
I have used min function which helps us to find minium value of the array.
I have used reshape function which helps us to reshape the array.
I have used split fuction helps us to split array (both 1d and 2d array).
And sorting fuction helps us to sort array's values.
